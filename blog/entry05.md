## Context

Compleating my MVP(Most Viable Product) has finaly been compleated and it is now working but with one minor bug that needs to be fixed but that is fine.During the time between this blog and blog 4 I have been working very hard in finishing my MVP. Scince doing all of that code on my own is very difficult and time consuming I have worked with my cousin who is an coding expert to help me with coding the math part for the calculator in the `.js` file. And also while I was working on my MVP I was also learning my tool and how I can implemet it into this project. What I decided to do Is that if the wind is too high or you are over weight then the background color would be red and their would be an alert that showed your plane is overweight, that is plane but that is going to be in the beyond MVP.


## Learining my tool

As I said before I neeed to use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to change the CSS of the outer boarder. and I have been learning form a youtuber called [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) where his cours helps a lot of people learn jquery step by step little by little.

So How will I change the CSS using jQuery? I will use this line of code here as this shows us the ID that we want to change and what we want to change in that ID, it can be whatever we want`$("#idName").css("proportyName")` so to change this I would have to add an `if` statment in the weght section in the js file and add this code `$("#centerTable").css("border", "red")`.

## MVP

Coding the CSS and HTML was the easy part of the project, but nun the less it was time consuming. I first needed to declare all the variables that will be needed in codeing this project for example `windSpeed`,`windDegrees`,`pressure`,`inputWeight`,`windSpeedRef`,etc. The longest pard of coding was the conversion chart. It gives us the V1,V2,and Vr speeds. what I had to do was convert the img below into code:

Scince thir was no proper chart for the Saab 340A I used this chart but changed the numbers a little because the Q400 is a much bigger plane than the Saab 340A.

Even though this is one part of the array thier is still more that includes the presure, tempurture, airport elevation, etc
