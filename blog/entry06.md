## Context

And with that, this is the final Blog of the 11th grade school year. In this Blog, I will write about The Expo and my takeaways. I will also be talking about my in-class presentation, How I prepared for it, what I said And what was my pitch for my product/what I made throughout the year.

## Class Presentation
When my name was called I was a little bit nervous but as much as I did last year in the 10th grade. I did fumbled a little bit just because you're presenting something you worked on the entire year. I was trying my best to make eye contact with my peers but for some random reason, I just kept looking at Mr.Mueller. While I was explaining something on the smartboard from my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YgQlro7tS7BhhFQ2h6Wf7eHIxhPnIrre8Ceac-b9F8Y/edit#slide=id.p) I looked back and The first person I tried looking for was Mr.Muller. I did not see him so I got nervous and stopped talking thinking where he is. I then stopped myself and continued with the presentation but I was stuttering and felt my body temperature Rise like crazy. So the next best thing to do Is just to think that in the end, we will all forget about it, I also looked at my friends just because they were scattered across the room and that will give me eye contact credit. After that, I stopped stuttering and finished my presentation.

### Takeaways in-class Presentation
* Dont focus on the Teacher/one person only, look around
* Dont look nervous when talking to a group of people
* Look at the people you know or partially know
* Try not to stutter as much as possible

## Expo elevator pitch

I think that the only reason I did not win was because I did not show up at the correct time to the expo. The day we had the Expo I just came back from a trip to Niagara Falls. It was an amazing experience to see that body of water just falling into another body of water. But we left Monday at 1 am. It took us 6 hours to get to my house All I did was take a shower change and then go to school. After the First period started I noticed that two classmates who were also in SEP did not show up and I saw them before class so I just forgot about it. In the middle of class, I decided to see if there was something and then I noticed that we had the expo. I told my 1st-period teacher that I had to go and leave for the cafeteria. After I arrived I saw everyone with computers and then I knew that I missed my chance in presenting my product. When I went to talk to Mr.Mueller and he gave me the TALK of why I was late and how I missed my chance. I apologized and prayed that the judges finish early to see my product and that my wish would come true. I gave them my elevator [pich](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFFgHtYxzYJSGMB3SJrH8gUJHFR5RGks6Ce_lXI9NiQ/edit#heading=h.i2r9vdne8gdz) "**Have you ever watched an airplane take off and wondered what goes into making that moment just right? What if there was a tool that could guarantee the perfect takeoff every time, enhancing safety for everyone on board? That's exactly what we've created.**" presented my product and the judges liked it but I knew that they did not like that I was late.

### Takeaways Expo Presentation
* Show up on time
* Look at the slides/announcements for major events
* Never travel on a School night

## Skills
During this process of presenting my MVP, I developed the ability to on **Growth mindset**. By Being patient with myself closely and being patient with myself. Another skill I learned was **Embracing failure**. I did not show up in time for the expo because I was very tired, and thus lost my spot in the final showcase. It happens and will try to never let that happen again.

## EDP(Engineering Design Process)
Currently, we are in the last part of the EDP (Engineering Design Process) which is to Communicate. Now that we have a working product all we need to do now is just Communicate and talk about the results of the project. Even tho this project can still be improved. It is still in its final stage.
