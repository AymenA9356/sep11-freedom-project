## Intro/Context


Between the blog 2 and bolg 3 I have learned alot of things that will help me get closer and closer to my goal of makeing a plane calculator. The things i have learned so far are `.add()` `.addBack()``.after()`. These are going to be important for my learning as these give me a basic understanding of jQuery.
